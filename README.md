# About StudioPieters®
- StudioPieters® is my public process for sharing innovative new technologies and collaborative development. The user feedback that you provide to StudioPieters® is really on ideas while they’re still in an early conceptual stage. The best way to learn is to start experimenting yourself and share your experience here.

- StudioPieters® is open source, and 100% free. Please consider donating to StudioPieters® before starting the fun of building and learning. 
- StudioPieters® is a <b>non-profit organisation</b> devoted to making creative use of electronics accessible to everyone.
